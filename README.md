Antikythera-Mechanism
An emulator of Antikythera's Mechanism in two distances



Executes the following operations:

Lunisolar operation which activates all mechanism's gears that are responsible for the Callipic Calendar, Metonic Calendar and Olympiad output.
Lunar operation which activates all mechanism's gear that produce Sidereal Month output.
Eclipse operation which activates all mechanism's gears that produce Exeligmos and Saros output.
Moon Phase operation which activates all mechanism's gears that produce the moon phase output.
Back Dial operation which shows the back dial of the mechanism. It also activates all mechanism's gears that are responsible for the output of back dial.
Front Dial operation which shows the front dial of the mechanism. It also activates all mechanism's gears that are responsible for the output of front dial.
All gears operation which activates all mechanism's gears.
This repository includes the following files:

-A folder for the Mechanism 's sketch files, which includes pde files representing one class each. It 's the code for the Lunisolar, Lunar, Eclipse, Moon phase, Back Dial, and All Gears operations.

-A folder for the Front Dial's sketch files, which includes pde files representing one class each and it's the code for the Front Dial operation. (I have added the above folders on this repo in order code reading to be much easier as pde files are seperated).

-A folder which includes Mechanism and Front Dial sketch in one pde file as well as the processing.js file in order application to be run on the browser.

an python code program use to run on web application 

Yes, Python code can be used to run on web applications. There are a few different ways to do this, including:

Using a Python web framework, such as Django or Flask. These frameworks provide a way to structure your Python code and to make it accessible to web browsers.
Using a Python microframework, such as Bottle or Falcon. These frameworks are smaller and more lightweight than traditional web frameworks, but they can still be used to create powerful web applications.
Using a Python serverless framework, such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. These frameworks allow you to run Python code without the need to provision or manage a server.
The best way to run Python code on a web application will depend on the specific application and the requirements of your users. However, all of the methods listed above can be used to create reliable and scalable web applications.

Here are some additional tips for running Python code on a web application:

Use a version control system, such as Git, to track your changes. This will make it easier to manage your code and to roll back changes if necessary.
Use a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the deployment of your code. This will help you to ensure that your code is always up-to-date and that it is deployed to production in a reliable way.
Use a web application performance monitoring tool to track the performance of your application. This will help you to identify any performance bottlenecks and to improve the performance of your application.


It is preferable to run application on Firefox
